# React.js Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the React.js project locally on your machine. Please follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (we'll use npm in this guide)

## Installation

## Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/ELHATTABIHamza/url-shortener.git
   
## Navigate to the project directory:
cd <project_directory>

## Install project dependencies using npm:
npm install

## If you prefer Yarn:
yarn install

## Running the Application
To start the development server and run the React.js application, use the following command:
npm start

## If you're using Yarn:
yarn start

The development server will start, and the application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- npm start or yarn start: Runs the app in development mode.
- npm test or yarn test: Launches the test runner in interactive mode.
- npm build or yarn build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
- npm eject or yarn eject: This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project, so you have full control over them.
